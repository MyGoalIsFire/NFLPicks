# NFLPicks

## About this project:
Each football season I've been involved in a 'Pick 4 League' where we pick 4 games against the spread. All participants that get all 4 games right, are ITM for that week. If no one gets all 4 correct, it rolls. 

My goal with this project is to come up with a deeper level of analysis for how I'm making my picks. I'm also learning about Python data anlysis and Github with this project. 

I'd love for others to contribute and offer suggestions. 

## Requirements:
- Python 3
- IDE of choice
- Knowing how to execute Python scripts
